In this task, you have the `year` variable.

**Your task:** in the `getCentury()` method, return a century this `year` is in. The first century begins in year `1` and continues up to and including year `100`, the second from year `101` to year `200`, and so on.


For example:
```kotlin
getCentury(1705) // 18
getCentury(1900) // 19
getCentury(1601) // 17
getCentury(2000) // 20
```
